We are going to have only two bundles.
The first bundle will contain our own code and the second bundle will contain everything from the node modules folder.


```js
 splitChunks: {
            chunks: 'all',
            maxSize: Infinity,
            minSize: 0,
            cacheGroups: {
                node_modules: {
                    test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
                    name: 'node_modules',
                }
            }
        }
```

Minimum size will be zero, which means there is no limit on the minimum size and maximum size will be infinity, which means there is no limit on the maximum size.
