Integrating Webpack

```js
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

`webpack-cli` is used to run `webpack` from the command line.

These packages are added a development dependencies.
Reason : You need `webpack` on the local computer in order to build the application however on most cases in the production service. 

Your application doesn't need `webpack` and `webpack-cli` in order to run in the browser.
Browser only needs css, js, html file generated by `webpack` but not `webpack` itself.

Webpack uses the production mode by default.

run webpack in developement mode from cli.
`npx webpack --mode=production`

Config Description
`entry: './src/'`
if we don't specify the file inside a folder, webpack will assume its index.js

If we don't specify the config for webpack it used default webpack configuration.

Default Webpack config.

```js
const path = require('path')

const config = {
	entry: './src',
	output: {
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
		filename: 'main.js'
	},
}

export default config
```


Webpack checks if there is a file named Webpack dot config dot JS in the project root folder.
if its there in the folder somewhere nested, we need to specify the path to our config explicitly.

Example:

```
npx webpack --config webpack/webpack.dev.config.js
```

Difference between development and production build sizes with the above config with respective mode specified.

from above observation, we can see that the production build takes longer than the development build.

### NPM scripts for development and production.

```
"scripts": {
"dev": "webpack --config webpack/webpack.dev.config.js",
"build": "webpack --config webpack/webpack.prod.config.js"
},
```


Webpack knows how to import only two kinds of files JavaScript files and JSON files.
The rest we use loaders for them.

Webpack allows you to import all kinds of things into your JavaScript code, and this is possible by using one or more `Webpack loaders`.

**A loader is basically a JavaScript library that knows how to import a specific file type into Webpack.**

- Webpack process loaders from right to left.
- `la -lah dist` - to see size of contents (files)
